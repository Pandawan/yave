Yet Another Voxel Engine (written in TS).

## Goals

- Simple but powerful true [ECS (Entity-Component-Systems)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system)
- Has all the basics to start making your own game, but is modular so you can replace things with your own systems
- Self-documenting code (along with generated docs) so you (almost) never have to meddle with the engine itself
- Uses modern ES standards for cleaner and fully-typed code
- Compiles to relatively new ES standards, I'm tired of supporting older browsers/versions
